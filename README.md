Sekala/Niskala: The Woven Cosmos FrameworkThis repository contains the source code, data, and supplementary materials for the Sekala/Niskala theoretical cosmology framework. This model proposes a structural reinterpretation of Dark Matter, Baryon Asymmetry, and the Arrow of Time as emergent properties of a CPT-symmetric, dual-universe topology.Our research program follows a strict cosmology-first validation strategy, prioritizing falsifiable predictions testable with current cosmological datasets (CMB, LSS, Weak Lensing).Core PublicationsThe framework is detailed in two primary documents:The Cosmology Preprint (v8.8): "Sekala/Niskala v8.8: The Woven Cosmos"Focuses on the cosmological model, the Candidate B effective coupling, and its validation against observational data.DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.17025011The Companion White Paper (v6.4.1): "The Sekala/Niskala Framework (v6.4.1): A Unified Model for Cosmology and Quantum Mechanics"Explores the broader implications of the framework, including its application to the Black Hole Information Paradox, Quantum Entanglement (ER=EPR), and other speculative frontiers.DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.16945128Repository StructureThe repository is organized as follows to ensure clarity and reproducibility:/papers: Contains the final PDF versions of the core publications./code: Contains all source code, including:/plot_scripts: Python scripts to generate figures used in the papers./class_config: Sample configuration files for the CLASS Boltzmann solver.requirements.txt: A list of Python dependencies required to run the scripts./data: Contains sample data files, such as the output from simulations./candidate_b_grid: CSV files for the 3x3 parameter grid of Candidate B./figures: Contains the source image files used in the publications.README.md: This file.LICENSE.md: The license file governing the use of the content and code.How to CiteIf you use this framework, code, or data in your research, please cite the core publications:Cosmology Paper:@article{DeJoannon2025Cosmology,
